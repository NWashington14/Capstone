    <h2>If you want to know about me</h2>
    <p>
      I was in 7th grade when I started coding. My mom signed me up for a coding
      class to get a free computer and I fell in love with it. Ever since, I
      have been learning as much as I can. In high school I took a coding class
      and learned HTML. It was only the basics, but it was so cool to learn and
      do. I took summer classes as well and just like high school I practiced
      HTML. When I graduated I went to Ranken and there I learned additional
      development tools such as JavaScript, CSS, and C#. It was more
      challenging, but the experience I got from there was amazing. Now, I'm
      attending the Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development boot camp and I'm
      adding even more technologies and tools to my toolbelt. Working on my
      capstone project is so rewarding and I'm looking forward to offering my
      development skills to a company that needs me!
