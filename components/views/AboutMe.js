    <p>
      I was in 7th grade when I started coding. My mom signed me up for a coding
      class to get a free computer and I fell in love with it. Ever since I been
      learning as much as I can. In high school I took a coding about html. It
      was only the basics html and it's a bit outdated, but it was so cool to
      do. I took summer classes as well and just like high school I did only
      html. When I graduated I went to Ranken and there I learned Javascript,
      Css, and C#. It was more challenging but the experience I got from there
      was the best I ever gotten.
